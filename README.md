### Developing data products project

This shiny app was developed as part of the Developing data products project.

We explore the Alzheimers data (from the AppliedPredictiveModeling package) to compare expression of various genes. In this shiny app, users can select two genes of interest and perform a Pearson correlation test between. You can also see a bar plot that shows median expression of the two genes in the case (those patients that are Impaired) and control groups.
